            <h3>Explanation of design choices.</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief note about why i chose my design like is the fact that these design choices aim to create a website that is user-friendly, 
                visually appealing, and functional. 
                By focusing on user experience, clear content organization, modern technical standards, and consistent aesthetics, 
                the goal is to build a site that not only meets the needs of 
                its users but also stands out in a competitive digital landscape, thank you for reviewing this.</p><br>
                <h3>Reflection on implementation process. (why I coded the website the way i
                    did)
                    </h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The implementation process of the website was guided by a commitment to creating an accessible, 
                user-friendly, and visually appealing platform as i have previously mentioned. Each design choice was made with the user in mind, 
                ensuring that the website not only meets their needs but also provides a pleasant browsing experience. 
                The process involved balancing technical requirements 
                and user expectations to deliver a high-quality product.</p><br>
